LangChain Samples is a collection of code examples, cookbooks, reference implementations, and workshop materials created by customer facing teams at LangChain. These resources are designed purely for educational and demonstration purposes, helping developers explore patterns, integrations, and best practices when building with LangChain and related tooling.

All code and materials published here are provided as-is, without official support. Any assistance is offered strictly on a best-effort basis, and users should not expect production-grade support or long-term maintenance.
